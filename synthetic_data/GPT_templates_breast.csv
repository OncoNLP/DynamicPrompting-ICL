1,"The cancer was identified in the Left breast, in the lower inner quadrant, and is characterized as Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) with associated Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS). The tumor measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm, with a grade of not specified, indicating moderate differentiation. The TNM stage is not specified. Lymph node involvement is Absent, with 0 nodes affected, and metastasis has been Absent. Key biomarkers include an Estrogen Receptor (ER) status of Positive (90% of cells), Progesterone Receptor (PR) status of Positive (80% of cells), and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status of Negative. The patient is Negative for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. The Ki-67 Index is at 30%, suggesting a High proliferation rate. Treatment started on 02/01/2024 with Left breast wire localized excisional biopsy, followed by not specified. As of the last update, the patient is showing No Evidence of Disease. Recurrence was Absent. Additional considerations include Family history of breast cancer not mentioned, Comorbidities not mentioned, ECOG scale not specified."
1,"The cancer was identified in the Left breast, in the upper outer quadrant, and is characterized as Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) with associated Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS). The tumor measures 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm, with a grade of not specified, indicating moderate differentiation. The TNM stage is not specified. Lymph node involvement is Absent, with 0 nodes affected, and metastasis has been Absent. Key biomarkers include an Estrogen Receptor (ER) status of Positive (85% of cells), Progesterone Receptor (PR) status of Positive (70% of cells), and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status of Positive. The patient is Negative for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. The Ki-67 Index is at 10%, suggesting a Low proliferation rate. Treatment started on 04/15/2024 with Left breast wire localized excisional biopsy, followed by not specified. As of the last update, the patient is showing No Evidence of Disease.

0,"The cancer was identified in the Right breast, in the lower inner quadrant, and is characterized as Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) with Metastatic carcinoma involving multiple lymph nodes. The tumor measures 3.2 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm, with a grade of high, indicating high differentiation. The TNM stage is not specified. Lymph node involvement is Present, with multiple nodes affected, and metastasis has been Confirmed. Key biomarkers include an Estrogen Receptor (ER) status of Negative, Progesterone Receptor (PR) status of Negative, and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status of Positive. The patient is Positive for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. The Ki-67 Index is at 40%, suggesting a High proliferation rate. Treatment started on 05/20/2024 with Right breast core needle biopsy and axillary lymph node biopsy, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. As of the last update, the patient is deceased. Recurrence was Not applicable. Additional considerations include rapidly deteriorating condition, multidisciplinary team discussions, and palliative care."
0,"The cancer was identified in the Left breast, in the upper inner quadrant, and is characterized as Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) with Metastatic carcinoma involving liver and bones. The tumor measures 3.5 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm, with a grade of high, indicating high differentiation. The TNM stage is not specified. Lymph node involvement is Present, with multiple nodes affected, and metastasis has been Confirmed. Key biomarkers include an Estrogen Receptor (ER) status of Positive (50% of cells), Progesterone Receptor (PR) status of Negative, and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status of Negative. The patient is Negative for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. The Ki-67 Index is at 35%, suggesting a High proliferation rate. Treatment started on 06/10/2024 with Left breast core needle biopsy and liver biopsy, followed by chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and supportive care. As of the last update, treatment outcomes were not favorable. Recurrence was Not applicable.
