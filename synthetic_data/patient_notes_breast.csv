Sec. #: --1234 Accession #: 987654321 Visit #: 876543210 Service Date: 02/01/2024 Received: 02/01/2024 Location: *** Client: Physician(s): Lee, David (() -) Green, Samantha (() -) White, Richard ((**) -) FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS Left breast, lower inner quadrant, needle core biopsy: 1. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC); see comment. 2. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with microcalcifications. COMMENT: Sections demonstrate several ductal units with enlarged, moderately pleomorphic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and eosinophilic, vacuolated cytoplasm. There is no definite distension of the ducts. Microcalcifications are present in association with these ducts. The findings are atypical and raise the possibility of atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, or invasive ductal carcinoma. To further the diagnosis, immunohistochemistry was performed and evaluated on block A1 with the following results: ER: Positive (90% of cells) PR: Positive (80% of cells) HER2: Negative MIB-1 (Ki-67): High proliferation index (30%) Taken together, the immunohistochemical and morphologic findings are those of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Given the associated microcalcifications, excision of the entire lesion is recommended. Dr. John Smith has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. The immunoperoxidase stain(s) reported above were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the UCSF Medical Center Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical testing. Specimen(s) Received Left breast lower inner quadrant (in formalin 15:20) Clinical History The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a personal history of breast cancer. There is now a palpable mass in the left breast lower inner quadrant. The patient undergoes biopsy of the left breast lower inner quadrant. Gross Description The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name, medical record number, and left, and specimen in formalin at 1520, and consists of multiple firm, white-tan cores of tissue (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate). The entire specimen is submitted as follows: Cassette **: Tissue originally in yellow embedding cassette. Cassettes A2-A4: Remaining tissue. (dc) Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations and preliminary interpretations performed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the final report. Jane Doe/Pathology Resident David Lee/Pathologist Electronically signed out on 02/02/2024 09:00 Evaluation of a 55-year-old right-handed woman with a history of bilateral upper extremity symptoms. The right hand is more involved than the left. She gets numbness and tingling in the 2nd and 4th fingers. She has trouble putting her rings on these fingers due to these symptoms. There is also tingling at the right elbow and upper arm area at times, but this is less frequent. She will awaken at night at times with the symptoms. She seems to be dropping things but is not sure if there is weakness. There is no radiating neck pain. She has been wearing night splints for 2 weeks which seem to be helping. She also has tingling involving the entire right lower extremity and an achy pain in the left big toe. There is no low back pain. There is no lower extremity weakness. On neurological examination there is normal bulk and tone. Strength is full in the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes are 2+ except for the left biceps which is down at 1+. Toes are down going. Pain sensation is intact. Light touch is normal. Tinel’s signs are absent at the wrists and elbows. IMPRESSION: Carpal tunnel syndrome versus ulnar neuropathy or left cervical radiculopathy. Procedure: Bilateral median, sural and superficial peroneal and right ulnar sensory nerve conduction studies were performed with surface electrodes. Bilateral median and right ulnar motor nerve conduction studies were also performed. EMG studies were performed with concentric needle electrodes of the bilateral upper extremities. Description: The results of nerve conduction studies are abnormal for: 1) an increase in right > left median distal motor latencies and right median minimum-F-wave latencies, and 2) reduced right median sensory nerve conduction velocity. The results of EMG studies are abnormal for mildly reduced recruitment of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in the right APB muscle. IMPRESSION: These abnormal electrodiagnostic studies provide evidence for bilateral (R>L) moderate demyelinating median neuropathies at the wrists (carpal tunnel syndromes). COMMENT: 1) There is no electrodiagnostic evidence of a right ulnar neuropathy or left cervical radiculopathy. There is also no evidence of a large fiber sensory polyneuropathy affecting the lower extremities. Lumbosacral radiculopathies were not assessed on this study. 2) She was advised to continue wearing the wrist splints and that if she did not get resolution of symptoms after several months of regular use, referral to a Hand Clinic for surgical release of the carpal tunnel could be considered. **********: ******* *******, MD Fellow () I have seen and examined the patient and discussed the case with the fellow.

Specimen(s) Received Right breast upper outer quadrant (in formalin 15:30) Clinical History The patient is a 45-year-old woman with no personal history of breast cancer. There is now a palpable mass in the right breast upper outer quadrant. The patient undergoes biopsy of the right breast upper outer quadrant. Gross Description The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name, medical record number, and right, and specimen in formalin at 1530, and consists of multiple firm, white-tan cores of tissue (2.8 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm in aggregate). The entire specimen is submitted as follows: Cassette **: Tissue originally in yellow embedding cassette. Cassettes A2-A4: Remaining tissue. (dc) Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations and preliminary interpretations performed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the final report. Lisa Brown/Pathology Resident John Harris/Pathologist Electronically signed out on 08/21/2024 10:00 Evaluation of a 45-year-old right-handed woman with a history of bilateral upper extremity symptoms. The right hand is more involved than the left. She gets numbness and tingling in the 2nd and 4th fingers. She has trouble putting her rings on these fingers due to these symptoms. There is also tingling at the right elbow and upper arm area at times, but this is less frequent. She will awaken at night at times with the symptoms. She seems to be dropping things but is not sure if there is weakness. There is no radiating neck pain. She has been wearing night splints for 2 weeks which seem to be helping. She also has tingling involving the entire right lower extremity and an achy pain in the left big toe. There is no low back pain. There is no lower extremity weakness. On neurological examination there is normal bulk and tone. Strength is full in the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes are 2+ except for the left biceps which is down at 1+. Toes are down going. Pain sensation is intact. Light touch is normal. Tinel’s signs are absent at the wrists and elbows. IMPRESSION: Carpal tunnel syndrome versus ulnar neuropathy or left cervical radiculopathy. Procedure: Bilateral median, sural and superficial peroneal and right ulnar sensory nerve conduction studies were performed with surface electrodes. Bilateral median and right ulnar motor nerve conduction studies were also performed. EMG studies were performed with concentric needle electrodes of the bilateral upper extremities. Description: The results of nerve conduction studies are abnormal for: 1) an increase in right > left median distal motor latencies and right median minimum-F-wave latencies, and 2) reduced right median sensory nerve conduction velocity. The results of EMG studies are abnormal for mildly reduced recruitment of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in the right APB muscle. IMPRESSION: These abnormal electrodiagnostic studies provide evidence for bilateral (R>L) moderate demyelinating median neuropathies at the wrists (carpal tunnel syndromes). COMMENT: 1) There is no electrodiagnostic evidence of a right ulnar neuropathy or left cervical radiculopathy. There is also no evidence of a large fiber sensory polyneuropathy affecting the lower extremities. Lumbosacral radiculopathies were not assessed on this study. 2) She was advised to continue wearing the wrist splints and that if she did not get resolution of symptoms after several months of regular use, referral to a Hand Clinic for surgical release of the carpal tunnel could be considered. **********: ******* *******, MD Fellow () I have seen and examined the patient and discussed the case with the fellow.
