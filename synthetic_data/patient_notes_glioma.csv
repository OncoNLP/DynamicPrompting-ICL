(Methylation index = 14) This result indicates the presence of CpG methylation in the promoter region of the MGMT gene in DNA isolated from tumor-enriched tissue of this individual’s paraffin section. Glioblastoma patients whose tumors are methylated at the MGMT promoter appear to derive benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy (Hegi et al., 2005). REFERENCE RANGE: Negative: CpG methylation was not detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index=0) Positive: CpG methylation was detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index ≥ 1) Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on glass slides (Outside: 17). Brain. Clinical History: 48-year-old male with a right parietal mass. Method: DNA was extracted from tumor-rich tissue from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain sections of this patient. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, amplified by PCR, purified with magnetic beads, and subjected to single-stranded DNA sequencing. 17 CpG sites were each assessed for the presence or absence of methylation, thereby providing a methylation index (range 0-17) that reflects the number of methylated CpG sites. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Eastern Health Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

COMMENT: This malignant glioma demonstrates increased mitoses (estimated at 9 mitoses/10 high-power fields), extensive areas of necrosis with palisading and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Eastern Health Medical Center on block G. Tumor cell nuclei show strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for GFAP, consistent with glial origin. A stain for mutant p53 protein is negative in tumor cells, compatible with wildtype IDH1. A stain for ATRX highlights scattered tumor nuclei, most compatible with a wildtype phenotype. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings support the diagnosis of a glioblastoma, most compatible with IDH-wildtype, WHO grade IV. Clinical History: The patient is a 48-year-old man who was found to have a large right parietal mass with associated edema, mass effect, and midline shift, for which he underwent resection. A Eastern Health neuropathologist is asked to review this case by Dr. Jane Smith.

PTEN Testing by FISH LABORATORY PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATION: Negative for PTEN deletion; see comment. The clinical interpretation of these test results should be evaluated within the context of the patient’s medical history, other diagnostic tests, and the histologic and immunohistochemical features of the tumor. An adjacent H&E section of the case was reviewed to evaluate tumor and normal tissue morphology and to identify the appropriate area of FISH analysis.

It utilizes a dual-color DNA probe set. The probe set includes the loci-specific identifier (LSI) 10q23/PTEN probe that binds to the PTEN target on chromosome 10q23, producing an orange signal while serves as a reference probe, producing a green signal. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on a glass slide is de-paraffinized and then treated with to digest tissue proteins and allow for probes to reach target DNA. The DNA is then heat denatured and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probe set. After hybridization, the slide is washed to remove any of the excess unbound probes and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole). Enumeration of the PTEN and signals is conducted by microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters. An H&E slide is reviewed prior to testing. Educational Note: PTEN deletion testing by FISH is not an FDA approved test.

(Methylation index = 13) This result indicates the presence of CpG methylation in the promoter region of the MGMT gene in DNA isolated from tumor-enriched tissue of this individual’s paraffin section. Glioblastoma patients whose tumors are methylated at the MGMT promoter appear to derive benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy (Hegi et al., 2005). REFERENCE RANGE: Negative: CpG methylation was not detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index=0) Positive: CpG methylation was detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index ≥ 1) Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on glass slides (Outside: 17). Brain. Clinical History: 50-year-old female with a left parietal mass. Method: DNA was extracted from tumor-rich tissue from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain sections of this patient. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, amplified by PCR, purified with magnetic beads, and subjected to single-stranded DNA sequencing. 17 CpG sites were each assessed for the presence or absence of methylation, thereby providing a methylation index (range 0-17) that reflects the number of methylated CpG sites. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Eastern Health Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

COMMENT: This malignant glioma demonstrates increased mitoses (estimated at 11 mitoses/10 high-power fields), extensive areas of necrosis with palisading and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Eastern Health Medical Center on block K. Tumor cell nuclei show strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for GFAP, consistent with glial origin. A stain for mutant p53 protein is negative in tumor cells, compatible with wildtype IDH1. A stain for ATRX highlights scattered tumor nuclei, most compatible with a wildtype phenotype. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings support the diagnosis of a glioblastoma, most compatible with IDH-wildtype, WHO grade IV. Clinical History: The patient is a 50-year-old woman who was found to have a large left parietal mass with associated edema, mass effect, and midline shift, for which she underwent resection.

PTEN Testing by FISH LABORATORY PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATION: Negative for PTEN deletion; see comment. The clinical interpretation of these test results should be evaluated within the context of the patient’s medical history, other diagnostic tests, and the histologic and immunohistochemical features of the tumor. An adjacent H&E section of the case was reviewed to evaluate tumor and normal tissue morphology and to identify the appropriate area of FISH analysis.

It utilizes a dual-color DNA probe set. The probe set includes the loci-specific identifier (LSI) 10q23/PTEN probe that binds to the PTEN target on chromosome 10q23, producing an orange signal while serves as a reference probe, producing a green signal. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on a glass slide is de-paraffinized and then treated with to digest tissue proteins and allow for probes to reach target DNA. The DNA is then heat denatured and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probe set. After hybridization, the slide is washed to remove any of the excess unbound probes and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole). Enumeration of the PTEN and signals is conducted by microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters. An H&E slide is reviewed prior to testing. Educational Note: PTEN deletion testing by FISH is not an FDA approved test. The test was validated by the Eastern Health Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory to confirm performance characteristics, in compliance with current guidelines for clinical implementation.

(Methylation index = 0) This result indicates the absence of CpG methylation in the promoter region of the MGMT gene in DNA isolated from tumor-enriched tissue of this individual’s paraffin section. Glioblastoma patients whose tumors are not methylated at the MGMT promoter appear to derive little or no benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy (Hegi et al., 2005). REFERENCE RANGE: Negative: CpG methylation was not detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index=0) Positive: CpG methylation was detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index ≥ 1) Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on glass slides (Outside: 17). Brain. Clinical History: 54-year-old female with a left frontal mass. Method: DNA was extracted from tumor-rich tissue from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain sections of this patient. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, amplified by PCR, purified with magnetic beads, and subjected to single-stranded DNA sequencing. 17 CpG sites were each assessed for the presence or absence of methylation, thereby providing a methylation index (range 0-17) that reflects the number of methylated CpG sites.

COMMENT: This malignant glioma demonstrates increased mitoses (estimated at 12 mitoses/10 high-power fields), extensive areas of necrosis with palisading and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Eastern Health Medical Center on block O. Tumor cell nuclei show strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for GFAP, consistent with glial origin. A stain for mutant p53 protein is negative in tumor cells, compatible with wildtype IDH1. A stain for ATRX highlights scattered tumor nuclei, most compatible with a wildtype phenotype. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings support the diagnosis of a glioblastoma, most compatible with IDH-wildtype, WHO grade IV. Clinical History: The patient is a 54-year-old woman who was found to have a large left frontal mass with associated edema, mass effect, and midline shift, for which she underwent resection. An Eastern Health neuropathologist is asked to review this case by Dr. Jane Doe.

It utilizes a dual-color DNA probe set. The probe set includes the loci-specific identifier (LSI) 10q23/PTEN probe that binds to the PTEN target on chromosome 10q23, producing an orange signal while serves as a reference probe, producing a green signal. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on a glass slide is de-paraffinized and then treated with to digest tissue proteins and allow for probes to reach target DNA. The DNA is then heat denatured and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probe set.

RESULT: Average number of PTEN signals per cell: 2.5 Average number of signals per cell: 2.5 Ratio of PTEN to : 1.0 Percent of cells with loss of chromosome 10: 8 Percent of cells with focal deletion of PTEN (Ratio of PTEN:: 1:2) 0 Number of cells scored: 50 REFERENCE RANGE: Not Deleted: Ratio of PTEN to > 0.8, Percent of cells with loss of chromosome 10 < 20%, and percentage of cells with focal deletion of PTEN < 20% PTEN deletion: Ratio of PTEN to <= 0.8 and percent of cells deleted >= 20% Loss of chromosome 10: Percent of cells with loss of chromosome 10 > 30% Indeterminate: Percent of cells with loss of chromosome 10: 20-30% Method: The PTEN deletion by FISH assay is designed to identify loss of the PTEN locus at chromosome 10 or loss of the entire chromosome 10. It utilizes a dual-color DNA probe set. The probe set includes the loci-specific identifier (LSI) 10q23/PTEN probe that binds to the PTEN target on chromosome 10q23, producing an orange signal while serves as a reference probe, producing a green signal. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on a glass slide is de-paraffinized and then treated with to digest tissue proteins and allow for probes to reach target DNA. The DNA is then heat denatured and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probe set. After hybridization, the slide is washed to remove any of the excess unbound probes and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole). Enumeration of the PTEN and signals is conducted by microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters. An H&E slide is reviewed prior to testing. Educational Note: PTEN deletion testing by FISH is not an FDA approved test. The test was validated by the Eastern Health Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory to confirm performance characteristics, in compliance with current guidelines for clinical implementation. The laboratory is CLIA certified to perform high complexity testing. I have personally reviewed the result of the molecular test performed and all clinical information supplied in rendering my interpretation.

Neurological examination revealed left-sided weakness and coordination difficulties. MRI showed a 3.9 cm mass in the right parietal lobe with contrast enhancement and surrounding edema. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, characterized by high mitotic activity, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. A craniotomy with Gross Total Resection was performed, and post-operative MRI confirmed complete resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of the tumor. Radiation therapy was initiated with a total dose of 60 Gy over 30 fractions. The patient began adjuvant Temozolomide (TMZ) following the Stupp protocol. At follow-up, the patient’s Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was assessed at 90, with reports of mild fatigue and improved motor function. Molecular pathology revealed IDH wild-type, MGMT promoter"

(Methylation index = 14) This result indicates the presence of CpG methylation in the promoter region of the MGMT gene in DNA isolated from tumor-enriched tissue of this individual’s paraffin section. Glioblastoma patients whose tumors are methylated at the MGMT promoter appear to derive benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy (Hegi et al., 2005). REFERENCE RANGE: Negative: CpG methylation was not detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index=0) Positive: CpG methylation was detected in the MGMT promoter (methylation Index ≥ 1) Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on glass slides (Outside: 17). Brain. Clinical History: 60-year-old female with a left parietal mass. Method: DNA was extracted from tumor-rich tissue from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain sections of this patient. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, amplified by PCR, purified with magnetic beads, and subjected to single-stranded DNA sequencing. 17 CpG sites were each assessed for the presence or absence of methylation, thereby providing a methylation index (range 0-17) that reflects the number of methylated CpG sites. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Eastern Health Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

COMMENT: This malignant glioma demonstrates increased mitoses (estimated at 12 mitoses/10 high-power fields), extensive areas of necrosis with palisading and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Eastern Health Medical Center on block S. Tumor cell nuclei show strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for GFAP, consistent with glial origin. A stain for mutant p53 protein is negative in tumor cells, compatible with wildtype IDH1. A stain for ATRX highlights scattered tumor nuclei, most compatible with a wildtype phenotype. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings support the diagnosis of a glioblastoma, most compatible with IDH-wildtype, WHO grade IV. Clinical History: The patient is a 60-year-old woman who was found to have a large left parietal mass with associated edema, mass effect, and midline shift, for which she underwent resection.
